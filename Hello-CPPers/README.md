# Hello CPPers

This project was an exercise in implementing a network of users and posts through C++. The main file is Cppeers-main.cpp.

The program has four main features:
1. Load data from a file and enter the information into the network.
2. Display the posts made by a specified user.
3. Display the posts made with a specified hashtag.
4. Display the most popular hashtag.

To run the program: after compiling with make, run the program with ./Cppeers. Then a prompt will be printed, and you may enter an option from the list of provided options. See the example.ipynb file for an example of how to run the program.
